 <h1 style="text-align: center;">Resume Extraction: Project Deliverables

<br> </br>
## 1. Introduction:

The project plan outlines the approach and timeline for the "Resume Extraction" project. The objective of this project is to automate the process of extracting relevant information from resumes using Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. Resumes often contain an abundance of information that needs to be manually processed by HR professionals, making the shortlisting task time-consuming and challenging. By leveraging NER models in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we aim to classify entities such as person names, college names, academic information, relevant experiences, skill sets, and more, thereby simplifying the resume screening process.

The project plan is divided into seven weeks, each focusing on specific tasks and deliverables. The plan begins with problem understanding, data collection, and data annotation. Then, it progresses to implementing NER models, training them on annotated data, and evaluating their performance. The subsequent weeks involve developing a Flask application for model deployment, testing the application for inference, and refining the model based on user feedback. Finally, the plan concludes with final reporting, including a project overview, methodology, results, and future recommendations.

This project plan provides a structured approach to effectively tackle the resume extraction problem, leveraging NER techniques to automate the shortlisting process and enhance HR efficiency.


## 2. Project Plan: Resume Extraction

- Duration: 7 weeks

### Week 7: Problem Understanding and Data Collection

- Define the problem statement and objectives of the project.
- Conduct research on existing NER models and techniques for resume extraction and understand the given dataset
- Set up a version control system and create a project repository.

**Deliverables:**
Problem statement, business understanding and objectives document.

### Week 8: Data Preprocessing

- Define the entity categories to be extracted, such as person names, college names, academic information, experiences, skill sets, etc.
- Annotate the collected resumes with the corresponding entity labels.
- Ensure consistency and quality in the annotation process.

**Deliverables:** Data Preprocessing dataset of resumes.

### Week 9: Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Explore different NER techniques and models suitable for resume extraction.
- Preprocess the annotated dataset, including tokenization, normalization, and handling of special characters.
- Split the preprocessed dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Implement and train an NER model using the training dataset, considering architectures like Bidirectional LSTM-CRF or Transformer-based models.
- Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and optimize its performance.

**Deliverables:** Trained NER model, preprocessed dataset split into training, validation, and testing sets.

### Week 10: Performance Evaluation & Reporting

- Evaluate the NER model's performance using the validation dataset, measuring metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analyze the model's strengths and weaknesses, and iteratively improve it by adjusting the architecture, hyperparameters, or training strategy.
- Generate a performance evaluation report, summarizing the results and providing insights into the model's performance and limitations.

**Deliverables:**  Model evaluation results, Performance evaluation report.

### Week 11: Model Deployment
- Develop a Flask web application that allows users to upload resumes for information extraction using the trained NER model.
- Implement the necessary backend functionality for processing resume files and applying the NER model for entity extraction.
- Set up a deployment environment (e.g., Heroku) and deploy the Flask application to a web server.

**Deliverables:** Flask application code, deployed web application.

### Week 12: Model Inference and Refinement

- Test the deployed web application by uploading sample resumes and extracting entities using the NER model.
- Collect user feedback and incorporate improvements based on usability and performance.
- Perform any necessary refinements or enhancements to the NER model based on the insights gained from real-world usage.

**Deliverables:** Refined Flask application, Updated NER model (if applicable).

### Week 13: Final Reporting and Submission

- Prepare the final project report, including an overview, methodology, results, and future recommendations.
- Create a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, approach, key findings, and potential applications.
- Practice and refine the presentation.
- Submit the final project report, along with the code and presentation.

**Deliverables:** Final project report, presentation slides.

*Note:* The tasks and durations provided are approximate and can be adjusted based on the specific requirements and resources available for the project.
